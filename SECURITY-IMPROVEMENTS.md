# Security Improvements

## Docker Vulnerabilities Fixed

The following security improvements have been implemented to address the reported 1 critical and 4 high vulnerabilities:

### 1. Base Image Updates
- **Updated Go builder**: Upgraded from `golang:1.21-alpine3.19` to `golang:1.22-alpine3.20` 
- **Updated Node.js images**: Upgraded from `node:21-alpine3.19` to `node:21-alpine3.20`
- **Security patches**: All base images now include latest security patches

### 2. Package Vulnerabilities Fixed
- **semver**: Updated from `^7.5.4` to `^7.6.3` (fixes prototype pollution vulnerability)
- **express**: Updated from `^4.18.2` to `^4.21.1` (fixes multiple security issues)
- **path-to-regexp**: Updated from `^0.1.10` to `^8.2.0` (fixes ReDoS vulnerability)

### 3. Additional Security Hardening
- **Non-root users**: All containers run as non-privileged users (`nodejs` or `nonroot`)
- **Distroless images**: Go services use Google's distroless base images for minimal attack surface
- **Security flags**: Go binaries compiled with security hardening flags (`-ldflags="-w -s"`)
- **CA certificates**: SSL certificates properly included for secure communications
- **Dependency verification**: Go modules verified during build process

### 4. Build Optimizations
- **Multi-stage builds**: Reduces final image size and eliminates build dependencies
- **Layer caching**: Optimized layer order for better build performance
- **Package cleanup**: npm and apk caches removed to reduce image size

## Security Scanning

Use the provided `security-scan.bat` script to regularly check for new vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run security scan
./security-scan.bat
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: All containers run with minimal required permissions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (image, network, runtime)
3. **Supply Chain Security**: Dependencies verified and updated regularly
4. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Containers rebuilt from scratch for each deployment

## Monitoring

- Regular dependency updates via automated security scanning
- Container image vulnerability monitoring
- Runtime security monitoring through Docker security policies

## Next Steps

1. Set up automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
2. Implement container runtime security policies
3. Regular security audits and penetration testing
4. Security training for development team
